# HMM, CRF, and RNN for POS Tagging

A comparative study of HMM,CRF and RNN for POS tagging the NLTK Treebank corpus

This project was done as a part of 19MAT301: Mathematics for Intelligent Systems-5
The project deals with explaining the concepts of Parts of SPeech Tagging and it's importance in Natural Language processing

The different concepts such as Hidden Markov Models(HMM), Conditional Random Fields(CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) are
explained in the report

The different ways to tag and the code to execute in python for the three different methods are available.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following files:

1. [RNN_POS.ipynb](RNN_POS.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations related to POS tagging using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
2. [CRF_based_POSTagging.ipynb](CRF_based_POSTagging.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook including code and explanations for POS tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
3. [HMM_based_POSTagging.ipynb](HMM_based_POSTagging.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
